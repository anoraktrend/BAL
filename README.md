# The-Berkeley-Artistic-License
The Berkeley Artistic License's GitHub.


This License was made as a means of creating a more legible and up to date Artistic License, that has been conformed to my personal interpretation of the BSD, (Berkeley), style. It differs from BSD and Artistic v2 in that it is not re-licensable and it is copyleft rather than permissive. It differs from GPL in that it's short, Clear, and accessible; that it can be used for more than just software as externally defined; and that it allows for credit right within the license. The license itself is likely Other or Redundant with GPL in terms of License Proliferation.

The "license" file here is an example of it in use, this license is actually licensed under CC0.

This license has the following features:

- Copyleft

- No Attribution by default

- Free Mirroring

- Contributors listed in the license

- Requires distribution of source and modified source

- Requires modifications to share this license
