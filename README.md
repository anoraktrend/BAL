# The Berkeley Artistic License
The Berkeley Artistic License's GitHub.

Current Version: BALV4

This License was made as a means of creating a more legible, correct, and up to date variation Artistic License V1, that has been conformed to my personal interpretation of the BSD, (Berkeley), style. It differs from BSD and Artistic v2 in that it is not re-licensable and it is copyleft rather than permissive. It differs from GPL in that it's short, Clear, and accessible; it can be used for more than just software as externally defined; and it allows for credit right within the license. 

The "license" file here is an example of it in use, this license is actually licensed under CC0.

This license has the following features:

- Copyleft

- No Attribution by default

- Free Mirroring

- Contributors listed in the license

- Requires distribution of source and modified source

- Projects using this license can be built and distributed with GPL code, gpl code cannot be used within said projects.
