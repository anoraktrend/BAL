# The Better Attribution License
The Better Attribution License's GitHub.

Current Version: BALV5

This License was made as a means of creating a more legible, correct, and up to date variation of Artistic License V1, that has been conformed to my personal interpretation of the BSD, (Berkeley), style. It differs from BSD and Artistic v2 in that it is not re-licensable and it is copyleft rather than permissive. It differs from GPL in that it's short, Clear, and accessible. It also requires a metadata file to credit developers in the license. 

This license has the following features:

- Copyleft

- No Attribution by default

- Contributors listed in a Metadata file.

The "license" file here is an example of it in use, this license is actually licensed under CC0.
