II: Definitions
Standard Version refers to the project which is the basis for modified versions, also known as upstream.

Modified Versions refer to partial or whole versions of the source code distributed by the project that have been modified, downstream.

The Software refers to the project, which is a collection of files distributed by the Project Developer, the "Standard Version", and derivatives of that collection of files created through modification of the source code, the "Modified Version".

Undue hassle, as mentioned in this license, means requirements to receive the source code that restricts the receipt of said source code behind acts which may prevent users from requesting it, or providing it in a form which prevents easy usage of it. Examples of this include, but are not limited to: requiring a phone call to be made when a letter of request is sent; requiring a letter to be sent when a phone call is made; sending the source code in the form of a book; or sending it in a proprietary media format which the user would not be able to access.
